## 🍲 A little about me... 🍲

I’m a backend-first developer in training who strives to contribute and build systems that protect data, reduce risk, and keep businesses running when things break.

My professional background has mainly been in healthcare, where mistakes cost real people real outcomes. That environment permanently shaped how I think about systems:

**correctness beats cleverness, reliability beats speed, and automation beats hope.**

I’m currently completing a Bachelor of Science in Full-Stack Web Development at Arizona State University (Dec 2026), but my technical focus lives deeper than front-end or features. My goals for my future career will see me work in the layers that keep companies alive:  
**databases, APIs, cloud infrastructure, security, and automation.**

## ⚛ What Changed ⚛

In early 2026 I made a deliberate shift away from “software engineering” toward **infrastructure engineering**.

Instead of chasing frameworks, I am committing to understanding and building:
- Data pipelines  
- Backup systems  
- Cloud environments  
- Security scanners  
- Monitoring and automation  

This GitHub exists to document that transition.

You’ll see commits evolve from coursework into **real-world systems**: things that back up databases, scan cloud environments, manage secrets, and expose reliable APIs.

This isn’t a portfolio of features.  
It’s a lab notebook for becoming the engineer people trust with their production systems.

## 🔧 What I’m Building 🔧


### <em><bold>These are concepts for ideas I want to build from scratch!!!</bold></em>

### **Business Data Vault**
A Python-based SaaS that:
- Connects to PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SaaS APIs  
- Encrypts and backs up data  
- Stores it in cloud object storage  
- Provides restore, audit logs, and compliance reports  

This is about **data safety, not dashboards**.

---

### **Cloud Cost & Risk Scanner**
A Python service that:
- Connects to AWS or Google Cloud  
- Scans for exposed databases, open ports, unused resources, and dangerous permissions  
- Produces security and cost reports  
- Sends alerts and remediation suggestions  

This is about **preventing silent disasters**.

---

## 🌛 What I Care About 🌛

These repositories focus on fundamentals that don’t go obsolete:

- Linux  
- Networking  
- PostgreSQL & SQL  
- Python  
- Cloud Infrastructure  
- Security & Encryption  
- Infrastructure as Code  

Frameworks change.  
These do not.

## 📌 How to Read This GitHub 📌

You’ll notice:
- Small, focused commits  
- Clear commit messages  
- Experiments alongside production-style code  
- Infrastructure files (Docker, Terraform, cloud configs) living next to Python  

That’s intentional.

This GitHub is not about looking impressive.  
It’s about showing how I think, test, break, fix, and harden systems.

---

## 🏥 Why Healthcare → Infrastructure 🏥

In hospitals:
- Data loss kills  
- Downtime kills  
- Miscommunication kills  

That mindset carries into everything I build now.

I don’t write code to make screens light up.  
I write code so **systems don’t fail quietly.**

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Actively Growing) 🛠

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python,postgres,docker,aws,linux,git" />
</p>
These technologies are ongoing areas of study for me. I understand their fundamentals and syntax, and I’m committed to continuously deepening my knowledge over time. I don’t claim mastery or deep knowledge but instead a mindset with an active pursuit of including them in my work. 

- Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript  
- FastAPI, PostgreSQL  
- Docker, Git, GitHub, CLI  
- AWS / Google Cloud  
- Linux, Networking, Security fundamentals  

---

## 🎯 Where This Is Going 🎯

I’m aiming for roles like:
- Cloud Engineer  
- Data Engineer  
- Infrastructure Engineer  
- Platform Engineer  
- Security-minded Backend Developer  

The people who build and protect the systems everyone else depends on.

## ☣ Side note ☣

I'll be attending <em>PyCon</em> this year in May that will be held in <em>Long Beach, CA</em>.
If you find me let's chat, discuss Python and all things coding!!
I'm interested in making friends and developing my network of like-minded individuals!
Find my information in my resume or feel free to email me on LinkedIn.



If you’re here to see how someone grows from coursework into real infrastructure engineering, you’re in the right place.
